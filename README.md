# biclusturing-using-suffixTree
Final Year Project

This project is a Python implementation of the Suffix Tree Based Bi-Clustering algorithm. The algorithm uses a suffix tree to represent a given dataset and clusters the rows and columns of the dataset based on common substrings in the rows and columns.
